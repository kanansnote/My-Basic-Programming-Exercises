## Learning Journey

- `C++` and `Java` code were written during my Bachelor's studies.
- `Python` and some `JavaScript` code were written during my self-study journey using a platform called [Mimo](https://mimo.org/) (including [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getmimo) version).
- `JavaScript` exercise-related code was written using quiz prompts in `ChatGPT`.
